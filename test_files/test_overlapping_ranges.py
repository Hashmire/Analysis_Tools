Test Suite: Overlapping Ranges Detection Validation
Purpose: Comprehensive validation of overlapping ranges detection functionality through
         system integration testing using the badge contents collector approach.

This test validates overlapping ranges detection by running actual CVE processing and
examining the structured sourceDataConcernReport.json output to ensure:
1. Overlapping version ranges are detected correctly
2. Different overlap types are identified (partial, identical, containment)
3. Cross-entry overlaps are detected when appropriate
4. Results are captured in structured JSON format suitable for analysis

Architecture: Uses badge contents collector (production system) rather than isolated
unit testing to validate actual system behavior and data flow.
